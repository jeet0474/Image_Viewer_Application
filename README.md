# Image Viewer Application

## Project Name: Image Viewer

This Python-based Image Viewer allows users to browse through images with various functionalities, such as forward/backward navigation, shuffle, slideshow, saving and retrieving collections of images. The application is built using **Tkinter** for the GUI and **Pillow** (PIL) for handling image operations.

## Features

### Core Features
1. **Image Navigation**: Move forward and backward through the loaded images.
2. **Shuffle Images**: Shuffle the order of images.
3. **Slideshow Mode**: Display images in full-screen slideshow mode with customizable intervals.
4. **Keyboard Shortcuts**:
   - Left Arrow: Show the previous image.
   - Right Arrow: Show the next image.
   - Escape Key: Exit slideshow mode.
5. **Menu Options**:
   - **New**: Reset the image list.
   - **Open**: Add images to the current image list.
   - **Slideshow**: Start the slideshow with the loaded images.

### Advanced Features
1. **Save Collections**:
   - Users can save the current image paths as a named collection in a specified directory (`saved_collection`).
   - Saved collections are stored in text files, and users can name them during the saving process.
   - Existing collections are listed for reference in the save dialog.

2. **Retrieve Collections**:
   - Users can retrieve and reload image paths from previously saved collections.
   - A dialog displays all available collections for easy selection.
   - Once a collection is loaded, the images can be navigated, shuffled, or displayed in a slideshow.

## Requirements

Before running the application, ensure that the following Python packages are installed:

- **Tkinter**: GUI toolkit (usually comes pre-installed with Python).
- **Pillow**: Python Imaging Library (PIL fork) for image handling.

You can install Pillow using pip:
```bash
pip install pillow
```

---

## How to Run the Application

### 1. Clone the repository or download the Python script (`image_viewer.py`).

### 2. Install the necessary dependencies.
If you haven't installed **Pillow**, use the following command:
```bash
pip install pillow
```

### 3. Run the Application
You can run the application directly using Python:
```bash
python image_viewer.py
```
This will open a window with the image viewer and allow you to interact with it.
