# Image Viewer Application

This Python-based Image Viewer allows users to browse through images with various functionalities, such as forward/backward navigation, shuffle, and slideshow. The application is built using **Tkinter** for the GUI and **Pillow** (PIL) for handling image operations.

## Features

- **Image Navigation**: Move forward and backward through the loaded images.
- **Shuffle Images**: Shuffle the order of images.
- **Slideshow Mode**: Display images in full-screen slideshow mode with customizable intervals.
- **Keyboard Shortcuts**: Use arrow keys for image navigation:
  - Left Arrow: Show the previous image.
  - Right Arrow: Show the next image.
- **Menu Options**:
  - **New**: Reset the image list.
  - **Open**: Add images to the current image list.
  - **Slideshow**: Start the slideshow with the loaded images.

## Requirements

Before running the application, ensure that the following Python packages are installed:
- **Tkinter**: GUI toolkit (usually comes pre-installed with Python).
- **Pillow**: Python Imaging Library (PIL fork) for image handling.

You can install Pillow using pip:
```bash
pip install pillow
```

## How to Run the Application

### 1. Clone the repository or download the Python script (`image_viewer.py`).

### 2. Install the necessary dependencies.
If you haven't installed **Pillow**, use the following command:
```bash
pip install pillow
```

### 3. Run the Application
You can run the application directly using Python:
```bash
python image_viewer.py
```
This will open a window with the image viewer and allow you to interact with it.

## How to Build an Executable with PyInstaller

To convert the Python script into a standalone executable, use **PyInstaller**. This will package the application into a `.exe` file (on Windows) or the appropriate executable for your operating system.

### 1. Install PyInstaller

If you don't have **PyInstaller** installed, install it using pip:
```bash
pip install pyinstaller
```

### 2. Generate the Executable

Run the following command in your terminal or command prompt to generate a single executable file:
```bash
pyinstaller --onefile --clean --noconsole --icon=view.ico --exclude-module numpy try.py
```

#### Explanation of the command:
- `--onefile`: Package the entire application into a single executable file.
- `--clean`: Clean temporary files before building the executable.
- `--noconsole`: Run the application without opening a console window (useful for GUI applications).
- `--icon=view.ico`: Set a custom icon for the application. Replace `view.ico` with the path to your icon file.
- `--exclude-module numpy`: Exclude the `numpy` module (if not needed).

### 3. Locate the Executable

After running the above command, PyInstaller will generate the executable in the `dist` directory inside your project folder.

- **Windows**: The executable will be in the `dist` folder as `image_viewer.exe`.
- **macOS/Linux**: The executable will be in the `dist` folder with no file extension (`image_viewer`).

### 4. Run the Executable

Navigate to the `dist` directory and double-click on the executable to run the Image Viewer application.

## `.gitignore` Configuration

To avoid committing unnecessary files (such as build artifacts and temporary files) to your Git repository, add the following `.gitignore` file to your project:

### `.gitignore`

```
# Byte-compiled files
__pycache__/
*.py[cod]

# PyInstaller specific files
dist/
build/
*.spec

# Virtual environment (if any)
venv/
.env/

# Logs
*.log

# OS generated files
.DS_Store
Thumbs.db

# PyCharm/IDE files
.idea/
.vscode/

# Jupyter notebook checkpoints
.ipynb_checkpoints/
```

### Explanation:
- `dist/` and `build/`: These folders are generated by PyInstaller when creating the executable and should not be versioned in Git.
- `*.spec`: This file is generated by PyInstaller to store the build configuration, which is not necessary to include in version control.
- `venv/` and `.env/`: If you're using a virtual environment, this will prevent it from being tracked.
- `*.log`: Logs generated by the application or during development.
- `.DS_Store`, `Thumbs.db`: These are OS-specific files that should not be tracked in the repository.
- `.idea/`, `.vscode/`: These are IDE-specific folders for PyCharm or Visual Studio Code, respectively.

This `.gitignore` will ensure that unnecessary files are excluded from your Git repository, keeping your project clean and focused on the essential code.

## Troubleshooting

### Error: **Missing DLLs or Dependencies**
If you encounter issues with missing DLLs or other dependencies, make sure you have all the necessary libraries installed and that you're using a compatible version of Python. You may also need to install any required external libraries.

### Error: **Icon not showing in the executable**
Ensure that the icon file (`view.ico`) is located in the same directory as the script or provide the correct relative/absolute path in the PyInstaller command.

### Example Directory Structure:
```
ImageViewerApp/
│
├── image_viewer.py  # Main Python script
├── view.ico  # Icon file for the application
├── dist/  # Directory where the executable is saved
├── build/  # Temporary build files generated by PyInstaller
├── .gitignore  # Git ignore file to exclude unnecessary files
└── README.md  # This file
```

---

## Conclusion

With this Image Viewer, you can easily navigate and view images on your system. You can also run the program in slideshow mode for a seamless image viewing experience. Converting it into an executable allows you to share it without requiring a Python installation. Enjoy!
